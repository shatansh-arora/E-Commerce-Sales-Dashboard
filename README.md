1. Project Title / Headline
🛒 E-COMMERCE SALES PERFORMANCE DASHBOARD

A dynamic, interactive Power BI solution built to monitor and analyze the sales, profit, and key operational metrics of an online retail business.

2. Short Description / Purpose
The E-commerce Sales Performance Dashboard is a visually rich and high-impact Power BI report designed to provide the owners and analysts of an online store with a 360-degree view of their business health. The dashboard enables users to quickly identify top-performing products, profitable regions, seasonal trends, and preferred customer payment methods. This tool is essential for data-driven decision-making related to inventory, marketing spend, and product pricing strategy.

3. Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies, as covered in the tutorial:

📊 Power BI Desktop – Used for visualization, report canvas design, and development.

📂 Power Query (M Language) – Used for data extraction, cleaning, and transformation of the raw sales and order files.

🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used to create key calculated measures such as Sum of Profit and Sum of AOV (Average Order Value).

⭐ Data Modeling (Star Schema) – Relationships were established among tables (e.g., separating sales facts from customer or product dimensions) to ensure accurate cross-filtering.

4. Data Source
Source: Internal E-commerce Sales Data (based on the "Madhav Store" client context from the tutorial).

Data Structure: The data model includes transactional sales records at the order level, linked to dimensions such as Order Date, Customer Details, Product Category/Sub-Category, State/City, and Payment Mode.

5. Features / Highlights
• Business Problem
An e-commerce business requires a cohesive way to track its vast number of daily transactions to maintain profitability and optimize operations. Without a central dashboard, owners cannot quickly answer critical questions like: Which months are least profitable?, Which state drives the most revenue?, or Are customers preferring COD or digital payments?

• Goal of the Dashboard
To deliver an interactive, single-page visual tool that:

Provides an at-a-glance summary of total performance using key financial and operational KPIs.

Uncovers seasonal weakness by analyzing profit trends across the year.

Highlights high-value customers and top-performing product categories.

Enables swift filtering by time period (Quarter) and location for focused analysis.

• Walkthrough of Key Visuals
Key Performance Indicators (Top Row): Provides the most critical summary metrics:

Sum of Amount: 438K (Total Revenue)

Sum of Quantity: 5615 (Total Units Sold)

Sum of Profit: 37K (Net Profit)

Sum of AOV: 121K (Average Order Value)

Profit by Month (Bar Chart): A crucial visual for seasonal analysis. It clearly shows that months in the middle of the year (July and August) experienced negative profit, indicating a potential summer slump or an increase in costs/returns.

Sum of Profit by State (Bar Chart): Ranks the top geographic regions, showing that Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Uttar Pradesh are the primary drivers of total profit.

Sum of Quantity by Category (Donut Chart): Shows that Clothing (63%) is the highest volume category, followed by Electronics (21%) and Furniture (17%).

Sum of Quantity by Payment Mode (Donut Chart): Essential for logistics and financial planning, revealing that COD (Cash on Delivery) at 44% is the most popular payment method, followed by UPI (21%) and Debit/Credit Cards.

Sum of Profit by Sub-Category (Bar Chart): A detailed view that identifies high-value products like Printers and Bookcases, while also spotlighting sub-categories with negative profit performance (e.g., Trousers, Stole).

• Business Impact & Insights
Marketing Strategy: The high volume in Clothing and COD payments suggests that marketing efforts should focus on low-barrier-to-entry sales channels and potentially target non-metro areas where COD is preferred.

Financial Planning: The negative profit in July and August requires immediate investigation into operational costs, returns, or pricing during those months to prevent future losses.

Inventory & Pricing: The dashboard immediately identifies sub-categories with negative profit (Trousers, Stole, Handkerchief), prompting the business to either re-evaluate their purchase price, increase the selling price, or discontinue the product line.

Customer Segmentation: Identifying high-value customers like "Harivansh", "Madhav", and "Shiva" allows the business to launch targeted loyalty programs to maximize Customer Lifetime Value (CLV).
